# SQL Employee Tracker

## Description
This project is an employee tracker using MySQL. It uses three tables: department, role, and employee, to track all employees, their names, salaries, manager, titles, departments. It can also update employees and add new ones. This project took me quite a bit of time to complete.  I learned a lot about MySQL, but perhaps even more about async/await while not using promises while doing this project. The MySQL database queries and the async/await callback functions were very difficult for me. I also had an issue seeding the database, but I feel very confident in these things now.

Once the packages are installed, you must use mysql command line to seed the database. Log in to MySQL via the command line and then use the following two commands: <SOURCE schema.sql;> and <SOURCE seeds.sql;>.  You must perform these commands while inside the folder that these files are in. Once those steps are complete, run the index.js file with node to initiate the application.
